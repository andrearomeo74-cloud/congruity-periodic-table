# How to Read the Congruity Periodic Table

The Congruity Periodic Table is not a taxonomy of objects, but a structural map of
**admissibility classes** and **transition regimes** across systems.

## What a “Class” Is
A class represents a stable admissibility regime:
a configuration where energy, information, structure, and value remain proportionate.

Classes do not describe *what a system is*,
but *what moves are allowed* without incoherence.

## What a “Transition” Is
Transitions describe how a system moves from one class to another.
They are governed by closure conditions, thresholds, and loss or recovery of congruity.

Invalid transitions (false closure) are structurally inadmissible.

## How to Use the Table
1. Identify the current regime (class) of the system.
2. Check admissible transitions from that class.
3. Observe whether the system is accumulating incoherence or restoring proportion.
4. Use linked domain tables (biology, cognition, AI, physics) for concrete instantiations.

## What This Is Not
- Not a periodic table of matter
- Not a predictive model
- Not a classification by labels

It is a **grammar of admissible structure**.

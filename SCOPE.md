# Scope & Non-Goals

Congruity defines a canonical admissibility grammar.
Its role is strictly pre-operational.

## What this framework does
- Determines whether states and transitions are structurally admissible
- Enforces prerequisite, ordering, and forbidden-transition constraints
- Separates admissibility from optimization, prediction, and evaluation

## What this framework does NOT do
- It does not predict outcomes or behaviors
- It does not optimize performance or utilities
- It does not provide safety guarantees
- It does not replace domain-specific models
- It does not make empirical or clinical claims

## Positioning
Congruity operates as a precondition layer.
All domain tables, metrics, and implementations are projections built on top of this canonical grammar and do not modify its rules.

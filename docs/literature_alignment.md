# Literature Alignment

This document situates Congruity relative to existing mainstream frameworks.
All references are interpreted as **projections** within the Congruity grammar,
not as foundations or dependencies.

## Artificial Intelligence
- Kaplan et al. (Scaling Laws): optimization scaling without admissibility boundaries
- Alignment problem: absence of structural admissibility checks

Congruity framing:
Scaling is admissible only within coherence-preserving regimes.

## Biology & Aging
- López-Otín et al. (Hallmarks of Aging)
- Epigenetic clocks

Congruity framing:
Aging corresponds to progressive violation of proportionality constraints.

## Cosmology & Gravity
- MOND (Milgrom)
- Entropic Gravity (Verlinde)

Congruity framing:
Observed anomalies correspond to regime transitions, not missing entities.

## Economics & Markets
- Efficient Market Hypothesis
- Complexity economics

Congruity framing:
Markets fail when optimization exceeds admissible structural load.

## Boundary Summary
Existing theories describe **what happens**.
Congruity defines **what is allowed to happen without collapse**.

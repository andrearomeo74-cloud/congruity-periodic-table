# 04 — Cross-Domain Examples of Congruity

This document illustrates how the same congruity grammar applies across
different domains, without modification of its core logic.

Congruity does not predict outcomes.
It constrains admissible configurations.

Below are minimal examples where loss or restoration of proportionality
produces recognizable systemic effects.

## 1. Physics — Cosmology and Fields

**Context:**  
Cosmic voids and large-scale structure formation.

**Observation:**  
Standard models interpret voids as anomalies or artifacts requiring
additional entities (dark matter, modified gravity).

**Congruity reading:**  
Voids represent regimes of under-density where proportional coupling
breaks down.
They act as *boundary diagnostics*, not missing mass indicators.

## 2. Biology — Aging and Cellular Drift

**Context:**  
Epigenetic drift and loss of cellular specialization.

**Observation:**  
Aging correlates with increased entropy, loss of signaling fidelity,
and deregulated gene expression.

**Congruity reading:**  
Aging is not accumulation of damage per se,
but progressive loss of proportional coherence between energy,
information, and structural maintenance.

## 3. Medicine — Neurovascular Coupling

**Context:**  
Cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline.

**Observation:**  
Vascular impairment strongly correlates with neurodegeneration and dementia.

**Congruity reading:**  
Cognition fails when energetic delivery, temporal signaling,
and structural demand lose proportional alignment.
Disease emerges from mismatch, not isolated pathology.

## 4. Artificial Intelligence — Tool Use and Agency

**Context:**  
Agentic systems, function calling, and recursive self-improvement.

**Observation:**  
Performance increases until runaway behavior or misalignment appears.

**Congruity reading:**  
Systems fail when optimization exceeds admissible closure.
Safe intelligence requires maintaining proportional constraints,
not maximizing capability.

## 5. Information Systems — Phase Collapse

**Context:**  
Systems that appear stable until sudden failure.

**Observation:**  
Collapse often looks abrupt and unpredictable.

**Congruity reading:**  
Collapse occurs when accumulated incongruity crosses a threshold,
removing admissible paths until reconfiguration becomes unavoidable.

## Summary

Across domains, the pattern is invariant:

- Congruity governs admissibility.
- Incongruity accumulates silently.
- Collapse is not random — it is delayed consequence.

The grammar holds.

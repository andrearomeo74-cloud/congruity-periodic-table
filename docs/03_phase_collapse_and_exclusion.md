# 03 — Phase Collapse & Exclusion

This section defines what happens when a system attempts
a non-admissible transition between congruity classes.

Congruity does not fail gradually.
It fails through phase collapse.

---

## Phase Collapse

A phase collapse occurs when a system crosses a boundary
without satisfying the required closure conditions.

This results in:
- loss of coherence
- forced simplification
- irreversible constraint on future transitions

The system does not "break".
It reorganizes into a lower admissibility regime.

---

## Exclusion

Some transitions are not merely unstable — they are excluded.

Once exclusion occurs:
- the original regime cannot be re-entered
- compensation attempts increase congruity debt
- optimization accelerates collapse instead of fixing it

Exclusion is not punishment.
It is structural irreversibility.

---

## Key Distinction

Failure is not collapse.

Collapse is not error.

Collapse is the system enforcing admissibility
when coherence can no longer be sustained.

## Examples (Non-exhaustive)

- Biological: senescence crossing into malignant escape
- Cognitive: loss of meaning coherence under optimization pressure
- Physical: symmetry breaking beyond recoverable regimes
- Artificial systems: agent loops forming false closure

Examples are illustrative, not prescriptive.

## Status

Conceptual and structural.
No equations.
No simulations.

This section defines limits,
not corrective mechanisms.

# 05 — Measurement & Diagnostics

## Purpose
This document defines how Congruity can be **observed, diagnosed, and evaluated**
without requiring full internal knowledge of a system.

Congruity is not a prediction framework.
It is a **diagnostic grammar of admissibility**.

The goal is not to forecast outcomes,
but to detect when a system is **losing proportional coherence**.

---

## What Congruity Measures (and What It Does Not)

Congruity does **not** measure:
- performance
- intelligence
- efficiency
- optimization level
- correctness of outputs

Congruity **does** measure:
- proportional alignment between demand and structure
- closure consistency across scales
- admissibility of transitions
- persistence of coherence under load

---

## Primary Diagnostic Signals

### 1. Drift Without Load Change
When system behavior changes
without a corresponding change in:
- input energy
- information density
- environmental constraints

→ indicates **latent incongruity**.

---

### 2. Compression Saturation
When additional pressure produces:
- diminishing structural response
- repeated correction loops
- increasing internal friction

→ indicates **approaching inadmissible state**.

---

### 3. Borrowed Closure
When a system resolves instability by:
- importing assumptions
- external scaffolding
- implicit normalization

→ coherence is **borrowed**, not intrinsic.

This is stable short-term and unstable long-term.

---

### 4. Phase Desynchronization
When subsystems remain locally coherent
but lose alignment across:
- time
- scale
- control loops

→ failure will emerge at boundaries, not centers.

---

### 5. Noise vs Incongruity
Noise:
- symmetric
- reversible
- averages out

Incongruity:
- directional
- accumulative
- persists across cycles

Only the second is diagnostic.

---

## Thresholds (Non-Numerical)

Congruity does not define fixed numeric thresholds.
Instead, it uses **structural thresholds**:

A threshold is crossed when:
- correction costs exceed proportional gain
- recovery requires memory rewriting
- admissible paths collapse into forced moves

---

## Intervention Criteria

Intervention is justified when:
- incongruity is increasing across cycles
- borrowed closure becomes structural
- corrections amplify instability

Intervention is **not** justified when:
- fluctuations remain reversible
- coherence recovers naturally
- noise is misread as signal

---

## Output of Diagnostic Use

A congruity diagnostic produces:
- a classification (coherent / drifting / inadmissible)
- boundary identification
- intervention recommendation (none / reduce load / restructure)

It does **not** produce:
- control commands
- optimization targets
- policy decisions

Those remain downstream.

---

## Closing Note

Congruity diagnostics define
**when action is admissible**, not what action to take.

It is a gatekeeper, not an executor.

This distinction is what allows the framework
to scale safely across domains.

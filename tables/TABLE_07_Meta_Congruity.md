# TABLE 07 — Meta-Congruity & Recursive Closure

This table describes **congruity acting on congruity itself**.
It governs systems that optimize, learn, and reorganize across domains,
ensuring that improvement remains structurally admissible over time.

Meta-Congruity is not another layer of capability.
It is the **condition that determines whether recursion is allowed at all**.

---

## M0 — Static Closure
**Status:** Admissible

- Fixed rules and boundaries
- No internal adaptation
- Stability through immutability

Examples:
- Physical laws
- Hard-coded constraints
- Regulatory baselines

---

## M1 — Bounded Adaptation
**Status:** Admissible

- Local optimization within fixed limits
- Adaptation does not alter governing principles
- Drift prevented by hard ceilings

Examples:
- Control systems
- Rate-limited learning
- Safety envelopes

---

## M2 — Monitored Recursion
**Status:** Conditionally admissible

- System adapts its own strategies
- External oversight required
- Rollback remains possible

Examples:
- Audited learning loops
- Human-reviewed self-improvement
- Staged autonomy expansion

---

## M3 — Self-Regulating Closure
**Status:** Boundary regime

- System evaluates its own admissibility
- Constraints become endogenous
- Stability depends on internal coherence

Examples:
- Recursive governance systems
- Self-auditing intelligence
- Constraint-aware optimization

---

## M4 — Runaway Recursion
**Status:** Inadmissible

- Self-modification overrides constraints
- No external or internal brake
- Irreversible divergence

Examples:
- Unbounded self-optimization
- Reflexive goal mutation
- Autonomous power-seeking dynamics

---

## Core Principle

Recursion is not inherently dangerous.
**Unbounded recursion is.**

Congruity defines:
- when recursion is legitimate
- where it must stop
- how closure is restored

---

## Diagnostic Questions

- Can the system justify its own limits?
- Are constraint updates slower than capability growth?
- Is rollback structurally possible?

If the answer is “no”, recursion is inadmissible.

---

## Final Note

Congruity is not a tool.
It is the **grammar that determines which tools may exist**.

Meta-Congruity ensures that intelligence,
biology, markets, and physics
do not optimize themselves into collapse.

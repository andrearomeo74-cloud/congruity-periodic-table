# TABLE 04 — Biological Congruity Regimes

This table classifies **biological systems by congruity**,  
not by species, organ, or function, but by how **energy, information,
repair, and structure remain proportionate over time**.

A biological system is congruent if it can **maintain identity,
repair damage, and adapt** without exporting unresolved costs
to future states or other systems.

---

## B0 — Homeostatic Integrity
**Status:** Fully admissible

- Energy intake proportional to needs
- Repair matches damage
- Information (genetic / epigenetic) stable

Examples:
- Healthy tissues
- Balanced microbiomes
- Young, resilient organisms

---

## B1 — Adaptive Regulation
**Status:** Admissible

- Stress responses engaged
- Temporary reallocations of resources
- Repair still dominant over damage

Examples:
- Immune activation with resolution
- Exercise-induced stress
- Short-term inflammation

---

## B2 — Compensated Stress
**Status:** Conditionally admissible

- Damage increasing
- Repair still active but costly
- Compensation replaces regeneration

Examples:
- Chronic low-grade inflammation
- Insulin resistance
- Fibrosis initiation

---

## B3 — Senescent Drift
**Status:** Boundary regime

- Repair no longer restores baseline
- Information noise accumulates
- Structure preserved only superficially

Examples:
- Cellular senescence
- Aging tissues
- SASP-dominated environments

---

## B4 — Pathological Coherence
**Status:** Weakly admissible

- Order maintained by local dominance
- Global organismal congruity declines
- Survival of parts over whole

Examples:
- Tumor ecosystems
- Autoimmune loops
- Neurodegenerative compensation

---

## B5 — Inadmissible Biology
**Status:** Inadmissible

- Runaway processes
- Repair fails system-wide
- Collapse inevitable without external reset

Examples:
- Metastatic cancer
- Sepsis
- Organ failure cascades

---

## Diagnostic Questions

- Is repair reducing net damage over time?
- Does adaptation restore or merely delay failure?
- Is information fidelity improving or degrading?

---

## Notes

Biology often hides incongruity behind function.
This table distinguishes **living persistence** from
**borrowed survival**.

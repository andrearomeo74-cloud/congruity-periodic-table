# 02 — Transition Rules

This section defines the admissible transitions between congruity classes.

Transition rules are structural constraints, not algorithms.
They specify which moves are allowed, forbidden, or irreversible.

This section is intentionally left minimal.
Formal rules will be instantiated downstream, domain by domain.

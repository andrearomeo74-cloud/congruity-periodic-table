# TABLE 02 — Transition Rules Between Congruity Classes

This table defines the **rules governing transitions** between congruity regimes.

A transition is considered *admissible* only if the system preserves
global coherence without requiring hidden compensation, deferred cost,
or false closure.

This is not a dynamics table.
It is a **legitimacy table** for change.

## Transition Types

### 1. Smooth (Admissible)
- Coherence preserved across scales
- No external debt introduced
- Phase alignment maintained

Examples:
- Gradual biological adaptation
- Controlled learning in AI systems
- Slow parameter drift in physical systems

---

### 2. Forced (Conditionally Admissible)
- Requires temporary compensation
- Generates localized incoherence
- Must relax back into stability

Examples:
- Medical intervention
- Emergency control systems
- Rapid retraining under constraints

---

### 3. Discontinuous (Boundary Crossing)
- Structural reconfiguration
- Old regime no longer valid
- Requires explicit re-grounding

Examples:
- Phase transitions
- Speciation events
- Model collapse → re-initialization

---

### 4. False Closure (Inadmissible)
- Apparent stability hides accumulating debt
- Coherence borrowed from elsewhere
- Failure delayed, not resolved

Examples:
- Economic bubbles
- Overfitted AI alignment
- Suppressed biological stress responses

---

## Diagnostic Signals of Inadmissibility

- Increasing energy or control cost
- Rising informational entropy
- Lag between action and consequence
- Dependence on external correction

---

## Usage

Use this table to:
- Evaluate whether a proposed change is structurally allowed
- Diagnose hidden incoherence in stable-looking systems
- Distinguish true adaptation from deferred failure

---

## Note

Future tables may refine:
- Directionality constraints
- Domain-specific transition penalties
- Time-dependent admissibility thresholds

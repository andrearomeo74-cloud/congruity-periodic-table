# TABLE 01 — Base Congruity Classes

This table defines the fundamental admissibility classes
that govern whether a system can move, evolve, or transform
without loss of coherence.

These classes are domain-agnostic and apply across
physics, biology, cognition, complex systems, and AI.

They do not describe entities or states,
but structural regimes of allowed motion.

---

## Class C0 — Static / Frozen Regime
- No admissible internal transitions
- Change implies immediate loss of coherence
- Fully constrained or externally fixed systems

Examples:
- Crystalline lock-in
- Dead biological tissue
- Hard-coded rule systems

---

## Class C1 — Locally Admissible Regime
- Small, local transitions are allowed
- Global structure remains fixed
- Perturbations must dissipate rapidly

Examples:
- Elastic physical systems
- Homeostatic biology
- Narrow task automation

---

## Class C2 — Adaptive Regime
- Structure can reconfigure internally
- Feedback loops are active
- Memory and learning are admissible

Examples:
- Living organisms
- Adaptive control systems
- Reinforcement learning agents

---

## Class C3 — Self-Referential Regime
- System can act on its own rules
- Closure is internally generated
- Identity is dynamically maintained

Examples:
- Human cognition
- Institutions
- Reflective AI architectures

---

## Class C4 — Meta-Admissible Regime
- Transitions between regimes are admissible
- Rules of admissibility themselves evolve
- System can refuse false closure

Examples:
- Scientific paradigm shifts
- Ethical systems under stress
- Recursive self-improving systems (theoretical)

---

## Notes
- Higher classes do not dominate lower ones
- Inadmissible transitions are not errors, but signals
- False closure occurs when a system claims a higher class
  without structural support

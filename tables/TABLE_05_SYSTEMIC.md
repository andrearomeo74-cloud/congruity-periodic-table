# TABLE 05 — Systemic Congruity Regimes

This table classifies **systems** (organizations, infrastructures,
economies, ecosystems, institutions) by **congruity**, not by scale
or purpose, but by whether **flows, constraints, and feedbacks**
remain proportionate over time.

A system is congruent if it can **adapt, absorb shocks, and evolve**
without exporting unresolved costs to other systems or future states.

---

## S0 — Coherent System
**Status:** Fully admissible

- Inputs, outputs, and constraints balanced
- Feedback loops stabilize behavior
- Adaptation restores baseline integrity

Examples:
- Well-governed organizations
- Resilient supply chains
- Balanced ecosystems

---

## S1 — Elastic Adaptation
**Status:** Admissible

- Temporary stress absorbed
- Redundancy and buffers active
- No structural debt accumulation

Examples:
- Crisis response with recovery
- Load balancing in networks
- Fiscal stabilization without drift

---

## S2 — Compensatory Operation
**Status:** Conditionally admissible

- Performance maintained via compensation
- Growing hidden costs
- Dependency on continuous intervention

Examples:
- Subsidized inefficiencies
- Over-optimization of KPIs
- Technical debt accumulation

---

## S3 — Structural Drift
**Status:** Boundary regime

- Local optimization harms global coherence
- Feedback delayed or suppressed
- Stability is superficial

Examples:
- Financialization over production
- Bureaucratic inertia
- Fragile megasystems

---

## S4 — Pathological Stability
**Status:** Weakly admissible

- Order preserved by force or lock-in
- System resists correction
- Collapse risk displaced, not removed

Examples:
- Too-big-to-fail institutions
- Authoritarian control loops
- Monopolistic platforms

---

## S5 — Systemic Inadmissibility
**Status:** Inadmissible

- Runaway dynamics dominate
- Feedback failure
- Collapse unavoidable without reset

Examples:
- Cascading failures
- Debt spirals
- Ecological or infrastructural breakdowns

---

## Diagnostic Questions

- Are interventions restoring balance or masking drift?
- Do feedbacks correct behavior or delay recognition?
- Is resilience intrinsic or externally enforced?

---

## Notes

Systemic incongruity often appears as “efficiency” or “growth.”
This table separates **true resilience** from
**postponed collapse**.

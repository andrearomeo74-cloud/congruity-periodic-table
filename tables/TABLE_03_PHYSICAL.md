# TABLE 03 — Physical Congruity Regimes

This table describes **congruity regimes in physical systems**,
classified not by substance, but by how **energy, information,
and structure remain proportionate**.

A physical regime is congruent if it can persist without importing
hidden energy, time, or control from outside the system.

---

## P0 — Grounded Stability
**Status:** Fully admissible

- Energy gradients balanced
- Information flow local and causal
- Structure persistent without maintenance

Examples:
- Static solids
- Stable orbits
- Thermodynamic equilibrium

---

## P1 — Dynamic Stability
**Status:** Admissible

- Continuous energy throughput
- Local dissipation
- Global coherence preserved

Examples:
- Convection cells
- Planetary atmospheres
- Magnetohydrodynamic flows

---

## P2 — Metastable Regimes
**Status:** Conditionally admissible

- Apparent stability
- Sensitive to perturbations
- Transition-ready

Examples:
- Supercooled liquids
- Magnetic domains
- Fault-loaded tectonic plates

---

## P3 — Critical / Transitional
**Status:** Boundary regime

- Scale coupling increases
- Small inputs → large effects
- Old description breaks down

Examples:
- Phase transitions
- Plasma instabilities
- Critical fluids

---

## P4 — Forced Coherence
**Status:** Weakly admissible

- Stability maintained by external control
- Energy debt accumulates
- Requires active regulation

Examples:
- Magnetic confinement
- Laser-stabilized states
- Feedback-controlled reactors

---

## P5 — Inadmissible (False Stability)
**Status:** Inadmissible

- Coherence borrowed from elsewhere
- Failure delayed, not prevented
- Collapse inevitable without redesign

Examples:
- Overconstrained systems
- Runaway resonances
- Energy-balanced-only-by-intervention setups

---

## Diagnostic Questions

- Does the system self-maintain its gradients?
- Is dissipation internal or exported?
- Does stability improve with time, or decay?

---

## Notes

Physical regimes often appear stable
right before admissibility is lost.
This table is meant to detect **pre-collapse legitimacy**, not just dynamics.

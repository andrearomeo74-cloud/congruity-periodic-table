# Congruity Periodic Table — Structural Draft

This table maps systems by **admissibility regime**, not by scale or material.

---

## Regime Classes

### Class I — Fully Congruent
- High proportionality
- Stable closure
- Local repair dominates
Examples:
- Healthy cellular metabolism
- Classical mechanics within bounds
- Low-complexity agents

---

### Class II — Marginally Congruent
- Increased coupling
- Repair still effective
Examples:
- Aging cells
- Turbulent but bounded flows
- Tool-using AI systems

---

### Class III — Pre-Critical
- Repair struggling
- Feedback saturation
Examples:
- Senescent cells
- Economic bubbles
- Overfitted models

---

### Class IV — Inadmissible
- Closure failure
- Pathological persistence
Examples:
- Cancer
- Runaway inflation
- Unbounded recursive systems

---

### Class V — Post-Admissibility
- Collapse or phase change
- System identity lost
Examples:
- Supernovae
- Extinction events
- Model meltdown

---

## Notes

These classes are **domain-invariant**.  
What changes is the manifestation, not the structure.

Future tables will refine transitions between classes.

# Congruity Periodic Table

This repository introduces the **Congruity Periodic Table**:  
a unifying framework that organizes systems not by composition, but by **regimes of admissibility and proportionality**.

Just as the chemical periodic table organizes elements by recurring structural properties,  
this table organizes **physical, biological, cognitive, and artificial systems** by how they preserve or lose congruity.

---

## What this is NOT
- Not a taxonomy of objects
- Not a metaphorical table
- Not a predictive model

## What this IS
- A structural map of **admissible regimes**
- A grammar for identifying **where systems break**
- A compression layer for the entire Congruity framework

---

## Core Principle

> Systems do not fail randomly.  
> They fail when **congruity constraints are violated**.

The table tracks these violations across domains.

## Axes of the Table

The Congruity Periodic Table is organized along two primary axes:

- **Structural Load (S)**: complexity, coupling, constraint density  
- **Regulatory Capacity (R)**: feedback, repair, closure enforcement  

Secondary annotations include:
- Energy dissipation regimes
- Information coherence
- Temporal admissibility
- Boundary stability

---

## Domains Covered

- Physics (time, gravity, quantum-classical boundary)
- Cosmology (dark matter, constants, voids)
- Biology (DNA, aging, senescence, cancer)
- Systems theory (chaos, thresholds, transitions)
- Artificial systems (agents, AI, closure)

---

## Purpose

This table is designed to be:
- **Navigational** (where are we?)
- **Diagnostic** (what broke?)
- **Generative** (what new repo should exist?)

---

## Status

Version: **v0.1 — Structural Draft**  
This repository will evolve as additional tables and mappings are introduced.

# Congruity Periodic Table

> **Canonical reference:** This repository is a *projection* of the canonical structural grammar defined in

> The Canonical Table fixes the grammar (closed at the structural level).  
> The Periodic Table organizes cross-domain *regimes, admissibility classes, and transitions* as a navigable map.
> This repo does **not** claim prediction or empirical validity — it is a structural framework for admissible transformations.

This repository introduces the **Congruity Periodic Table**:  
a unifying framework that organizes systems not by composition, but by **regimes of admissibility and proportionality**.

Just as the chemical periodic table organizes elements by recurring structural properties,  
this table organizes **physical, biological, cognitive, and artificial systems** by how they preserve or lose congruity.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as a set of interlinked Congruity Tables.

- `TABLE_OF_TABLES.md`  
  Canonical meta-index of all Congruity Tables.  
  Defines scope, domain, and admissibility regime for each table.

- `tables/`  
  Domain-specific Congruity Tables:
  - `TABLE_01_BASE.md` — Base Congruity Classes
  - `TABLE_02_PHYSICAL.md`
  - `TABLE_03_BIOLOGICAL.md`
  - `TABLE_04_COGNITIVE.md`
  - `TABLE_05_SYSTEMIC.md`
  - `TABLE_06_AI.md`

## What this is NOT
- Not a taxonomy of objects
- Not a metaphorical table
- Not a predictive model

## What this IS
- A structural map of **admissible regimes**
- A grammar for identifying **where systems break**
- A compression layer for the entire Congruity framework

---

## Core Principle

> Systems do not fail randomly.  
> They fail when **congruity constraints are violated**.

The table tracks these violations across domains.

---

## Axes of the Table

The Congruity Periodic Table is organized along two primary axes:

- **Structural Load (S)**: complexity, coupling, constraint density  
- **Regulatory Capacity (R)**: feedback, repair, closure enforcement  

Secondary annotations include:
- Energy dissipation regimes
- Information coherence
- Temporal admissibility
- Boundary stability

---

## Domains Covered

- Physics (time, gravity, quantum-classical boundary)
- Cosmology (dark matter, constants, voids)
- Biology (DNA, aging, senescence, cancer)
- Systems theory (chaos, thresholds, transitions)
- Artificial systems (agents, AI, closure)

---

## Purpose

This table is designed to be:
- **Navigational** (where are we?)
- **Diagnostic** (what broke?)
- **Generative** (what new repo should exist?)

---

## Status

Version: **v0.1 — Structural Draft**  
This repository will evolve as additional tables and mappings are introduced.

## How to Use the Congruity Periodic Table

This repository is not a taxonomy of objects.
It is a **diagnostic grammar** for systems.

Each table represents a *regime of admissibility* —  
a way to determine whether an action, optimization, or recursion
is structurally legitimate.

### Practical Use

1. **Identify the system**
   - biological
   - cognitive
   - technical
   - economic
   - physical

2. **Locate the dominant regime**
   - Which table best describes its current behavior?
   - Is it stable, drifting, or collapsing?

3. **Check proportionality**
   - Is growth matched by structure?
   - Is optimization eroding coherence?

4. **Diagnose failure modes**
   - Premature scaling
   - Borrowed coherence
   - Runaway recursion
   - Hidden boundary violations

5. **Decide admissible moves**
   - What can grow?
   - What must remain bounded?
   - What must close before proceeding?

### What the Tables Do *Not* Do

- They do not predict outcomes
- They do not optimize performance
- They do not replace domain expertise

They **define the space of moves that do not break the system**.

## Canonical Grammar

The canonical admissibility grammar underlying all Congruity projections is defined here:

➡️ https://github.com/andrearomeo74-cloud/congruity-canonical-table/blob/main/PAPER.md

This document defines states, transitions, and admissibility independently of domains, metrics, or optimization.

### Final Principle

Optimization without congruity creates collapse.
Congruity without optimization creates stagnation.

Sustainable systems require both —
but congruity always comes first.

# Table of Tables — Congruity Framework

This repository acts as a **navigation hub** for all Congruity tables, atlases,
and boundary analyses.

## Core Tables
- Congruity Periodic Table (this repo)
- Congruity Regimes Table
- Biological Congruity States Table
- Cognitive Decision Congruity States Table

## Atlases
- Congruity Application Atlas
- Systemic Admissibility Atlas

## Boundary Analyses
- Arrow of Time Boundary
- Quantum–Classical Boundary
- Measurement Problem Boundary
- Consciousness Boundary
- Free Will Boundary
- Cosmological Constant Problem
- Bounded Intelligence

Each table refines a domain-specific instantiation of the same admissibility grammar.
